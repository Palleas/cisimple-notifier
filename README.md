# cisimple notifier

![Hope Kevin won't mind if I steal his screenshot](https://dqybdml3bjzsy.cloudfront.net/assets/dev_center/third_party/screenshot1-1b1c063af294af814188383db4f8ab8a.png)

This application connects to cisimple and sends you a notification when something happens on one of your jobs :
  
  * When a job was queued
  * When a job started
  * When a job succeeded / failed

Download it directly from [cisimple](https://www.cisimple.com/dev_center/#third_party).

## Installation

(I'm assuming [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) is installed on your machine)

    $ git clone git@github.com:Palleas/cisimple-notifier.git
    $ cd cisimple-notifier
    $ pod install
    $ open CISimple-notifier.xcworkspace
