# Ship.io Notifier

![screen shot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This application connects to ship.io and sends you a notification when something happens on one of your jobs :
  
  * When a job was queued
  * When a job started
  * When a job succeeded / failed

Download it directly from [ship.io](https://ship.io/help/#third_party).

## Installation

(I'm assuming [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) is installed on your machine)

    $ git clone git@github.com:Palleas/shipio-notifier.git
    $ cd shipio-notifier
    $ pod install
    $ open ShipIO-notifier.xcworkspace
